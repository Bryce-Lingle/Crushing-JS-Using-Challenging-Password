# Crushing-JS-Using-Challenging-Password

## Description

In this website I created a generate password function that was respnsive to the users input. The CSS and HTML files were already provided, I was asked to add to the JavaScript file in order to meet the many different requirements put in place by UC Berkeley. Using my knowledge of JavaScript, I built a browser to meet those requirements. This page was completed while I am at UC Berkeley's coding bootcamp. 

As a side note, when looking at my repository for this assignment, you will see that there is only a couple commits to GitLab. Unfortuantely, my knowledge of gitHub is sub par, and so, out of desperation to save my assignment, I deleted it in panic due to the fact that I made adjustments on GitHub which stopped me from being able to have my browser and gitHub communicate. Without knowing how to resolve the issue, I took SCREENSHOTS OF MY COMMITS AND PLACED THEM IN THE ASSETS FOLDER OF THIS ASSIGNMENT. I APOLOGIZE TO MY GRADERS FOR THE INCONVININCE IN NOT BEING ABLE TO SEE MY WORK AS I COMPLETED IT.
